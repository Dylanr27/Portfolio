    <h2>About me:</h2>
    <p>
      I have been a gamer all my life, video games are my first love and they
      will always be a major part of my life. That being said more than anything
      I want to create a video game of my own. I play all genres of games, such
      as RTS, deck builders, rougelikes, horror games, zen games, souls, rpg's,
      fps, etc, I play them all. I have always dreamed of being a part of the
      development of video games, and I hope this project will be the first of
      many to come.

    <h2>Project - Game - Winter - 2022</h2>
    <p>
      A few years ago I played my first rougelike called Dead Cells published by
      Motion twin. Dead Cells is a side scrolling, hack and slash, rougelike
      with tons of variety in the weapons, abilities, and routes you get to use
      through each playrough. Each time you failed, you would have to restart
      but your character would in most cases have gained abilities or weapons
      that they could utilize from the start or access quickly on there next
      playthrough. I found this gameplay loop along with the game being farely
      challenging to be a model for a very fun game. Ive since played other
      rougelikes such as Hades, Risk of Rain, and most recently Inscryption, and
      its safe to say ive become quite the fan of this genre. I believe a
      rougelike type of game would be a good place for me to start. My current
      thoughts are that I would look at Dead Cells as inspiration and go with a
      side scrolling type of game. I used to love castle crashers when i was
      younger, and i think a rougelike with that art style would be really cool.
      The medival theme is kind of already done by both dead cells and castle
      crashers, so perhaps a direction i could take my game could be having
      futuristic cyberpunk style weapons and abilites. A side scrolling
      cyberpunk Dead Cells with castle crashers art style sounds like something
      id love to make.
